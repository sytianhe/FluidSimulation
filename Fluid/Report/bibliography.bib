	Abstract = {{This book is an introduction to level set methods and dynamic implicit surfaces. These are powerful techniques for analyzing and computing moving fronts in a variety of different settings. While it gives many examples of the utility of the methods to a diverse set of applications, it also gives complete numerical analysis and recipes, which will enable users to quickly apply the techniques to real problems. The book begins with a description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, re-initialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method and the motion of co-dimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the fields of Image Processing and Computer Vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to Computational Physics. It begins with one phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke, free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water, and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change its topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful.}},

@article{greene2005,
	Abstract = {The aerodynamic constraints operating on the wind-dispersed, drag-producing diaspores of several species of the tropical family Bombacaceae were examined. Kapok (the drag-promoting appendage) was best characterized as a moderately flattened hemisphere impervious to air movement. The kapok shape was not isometric: kapok planform area was proportional to the kapok mass raised to the power 0.52 rather than to the 0.67 expected from isometry. Thus, necessarily, terminal velocity rises with seed mass much faster in this group than among taxa with winged seeds. Further, we derived the optimality argument to show that the kapok mass ought to be about 50% of the total diaspore mass (seed plus kapok). While seven of eight species had a lower kapok investment than this, and none were especially close to the theoretically optimal value, nonetheless the kapok investment values were hardly draws from a random distribution. Finally, the kapok fibers of these Bombacaceae species begin to bend at a drag of about 0.005 N, and this sets an upper limit on the efficient diaspore size of about 250 mg for the seed mass. This latter value is similar to the mass of the largest seed we know of in this family.},

@article{tackenberg2003,
	Abstract = {We developed PAPPUS, a trajectory model for wind dispersal of plant diaspores under field conditions. The model considers the effects of topography, turbulence (including thermal updrafts), and different weather conditions on the dispersibility of diaspores by wind. In the model, the plant species are characterized by the initial release height and the falling velocity of their diaspores. The common problems in modeling turbulence, which limit the applicability of existing models in predicting long-distance dispersal, are avoided by measuring the high-frequency fluctuations of the wind vector and using these data to simulate the course of the wind vector in the model. Using PAPPUS, we simulated dispersal distance spectra and compared them with those observed during field experiments executed in open habitats. Within a broad range of landscapes and under different weather conditions, the results of the model represent the observed spectra reasonably well. Additionally, we compared the observed dispersal distance spectra with the predictions of an existing plume and trajectory model, respectively. PAPPUS was the only model capable of predicting the proportion of diaspores dispersed over long distances; the existing models were unable to predict that proportion. This is particularly true for sunny weather conditions with thermal turbulence and updrafts, because these conditions may result in a high proportion of long-distance dispersal, even if the horizontal wind speed is low. In contrast, windy or stormy weather may be of much smaller importance for long-distance dispersal than is commonly assumed, especially for non-tree species with $V_{term}&lt;1.5\;m/s$. Horizontal wind speed was not correlated with the proportion of diaspores dispersing >100 m, whereas the frequency of updrafts was. Furthermore, the effects of landscape topography on dispersal distances were examined in simulations using PAPPUS. Differences in elevation and slope may affect the dispersal distance spectra considerably. The superior performance of PAPPUS in predicting long-distance dispersal is mainly due to the new method of incorporating turbulence (especially thermal updrafts) and the consideration of topographic effects. Because other wind dispersal models applied to diaspore dispersal thus far do not consider thermal updrafts or topography, they may considerably underestimate the dispersibility of plant diaspores by wind.},

	Abstract = {Models of seed dispersal-a key process in plant spatial dynamics-have played a fundamental role in representing dispersal patterns, investigating dispersal processes, elucidating the consequences of dispersal for populations and communities, and explaining dispersal evolution. Mechanistic models of seed dispersal have explained seed dispersion patterns expected under different conditions, and illuminated the circumstances that lead to long-distance dispersal in particular. Phenomenological models have allowed us to describe dispersal pattern and can be incorporated into models of the implications of dispersal. Perhaps most notably, population and community models have shown that not only mean dispersal distances but also the entire distribution of dispersal distances are critical to range expansion rates, recruitment patterns, genetic structure, metapopulation dynamics, and ultimately community diversity at different scales. Here, we review these developments, and provide suggestions for further research.},

Questions are raised in relation to both, 'plant structure' and its 'functional role'. Experiments are developed to obtain answers, and to prompt further questions resulting from these answers. This was shown in an exemplary way in the unusually geophilous strategies of Hemerocallis fulva, well adapted to fulfilling the function 'cryptical survival'. Thus, investigation of functional morphology is useful for a better understanding of plant behaviour. The second case study relates to dispersal of diaspores in Apiaceae. Wind tunnel experiments were carried out to analyze the 'flying ability' of winged or spiny mericarps. In general, winged diaspores fly better than spiny ones, except in the case of Daucus muricatus, the spiny diaspores of which fly better than the winged ones, e.g., of Prangos pabularia. Thus, this topic was useful in showing that functional approaches to 'plant structure' may reveal new perspectives in ecological understanding. However, 'form' and 'function' are frequent in botanical literature, showing that a dualistic treatment of plant structures is very helpful for a better understanding of plant biology. Besides 'underground plant movement' and 'dispersal' there are important topics such as 'floral ecology', 'biomechanics', and many more. All of these could be included in one category, which we propose to call 'plant construction'. Scientific work on 'plant construction' should be based on three basic principles: 1. The starting point of the investigation should be the specific form itself, 2. The scientific question should be functional, and 3. Scientific investigation should be based on targeted observation and experiment.},

	Abstract = {We compared a variety of models for the analysis of data on the wind dispersal of seeds and pollen. Dispersal distances from a source depend upon such factors as settling velocity, height of release, wind speed and turbulence, and specific morphological adaptations for dispersal. The dispersal curve, which describes the frequency distribution of dispersal distances, usually shows its peak at some distance from a source and falls off with distance. We used the location of that peak as a measure of dispersal, and organized data in terms of the predictions of two models for the dynamics of advection and diffusion. These data are summarized in a seed dispersal diagram in which the modal distance normalized by the height of seed release is plotted against the mean with speed normalized by the falling speed of seeds. Data from 15 studies were used to compare actual dispersal relationships.},
