\begin{abstract}
Wind dispersal of  seeds is an important mechanism for mobility in many plant species.  Unlike other dispersal mechanisms, wind dispersal is chiefly a function of seed morphology.  Primarily isolated from the  complex ecology of the plant's environment during this critical stage of a life, physical simulation provides a way to  quantify the fitness of different seed morphologies .   As a first step toward this quantification, we  implement a  framework for stable 2D fluid simulation with rigid body coupling.

\section{Conclusion}
We have described a simulation based approach  for quantifying the aerodynamics of random 2D shapes.  Applied to plant seeds, this approach provides for an (approximate) global understanding of the fitness landscape for seed morphology.  While we only present this project as a proof of concept, our approach has direct implications for the understanding of seed morphology, dispersal, population dynamics, and evolution.
