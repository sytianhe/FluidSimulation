\section{Introduction}
%Wind dispersal of  seeds is an important mechanism for mobility in many plant species.  Unlike other dispersal mechanisms, wind dispersal is chiefly a function of seed morphology (and wind patterns).  Primarily isolated from the  complex ecology of the plant's environment during this critical stage of a life, physical simulation provides a way to  quantify the fitness of different seed morphologies. 

%Mobility is a central challenges for all living organism.   

Dispersal is the process by which an organism moves way from it's place of birth.  This process is central to understanding  population structure and dynamics, gene-flow, evolution and speciation, as well as many other biological phenomenon\cite{levin1989}.   In general, the mechanism for dispersion is difficult to model precisely. An organism may be mobile for it's entire life, and it's motions may be dictated by complicated behavior and interactions with other species.  For sessile organisms, the dispersal process is often restricted to a single phase in the organism's life in which the organism is essentially passive \cite{nathan2000}.   Such organisms lend themselves to mechanistic understanding.  

Seed plants serve as a model candidate. But even in this passive system, the mechanism for distribution remain surpassingly complex.  Fruits, which beer a seed at it's center, provides one mechanism for seed dispersal, effectively by `convincing' certain frugivores  to eat them. Here, the dispersal process is handed off to an animal which is both much more adept to the task, and much more difficult to model. This plant animal exchange also has non-trivial evolutionary implications; the explosive evolution of fruit bearing plants is  attributed in part to this symbiotic relationships between plant and animals \cite{lorts2008}.  In contrast, wind dispersal provides an entirely physical process that is notably decoupled from the complexity of biology.   


Wind-dispersed seeds have been studied previously through empirical analysis of seed morphology and flight characteristics \cite{augspurger1986}.  Much of this work has been applied to  theoretical ballistic and plum models  to obtain plausible explinations for spatial population dynamics and pattern formation \cite{levin2003}.  This work has tried to understand spatial pattern formation in plant populations through comprehensive statistical modeling of seed distribution as a result of seed ballistics.  Recent work has begun to consider  the evolutionary implications of spatial segregation, as a result of wind dispersal \cite{Cheptou2008} \cite{levin2010}.  




Wind dispersal of seeds is predominately physical in nature.    For this reason, it has received considerable interest 




Wind dispersion of seeds is typically studied as a combination of empirical analysis of real seed flight characteristics and statistical modeling of seed plumes   .  While this approach effectively captures 


 Specifically, by sampling from the space of possible seed morphologies and simulating their flight characteristics, it is possible to generate a complete fitness landscape.  From this fitness landscape we may quantify local and global stability of real seeds, or consider morphological pathways in this space.  Our simulation intensive approach has direct implications on the understanding of seed development and plant mobility.  It yields a physically based model for certain evolutionary features in plants.   Our approach yields a quantitative framework in which to consider many theoretical questions from evolutionary, developmental, and ecological biology.  


Most animals have adapted some physical mobility, making dispersal a process dominated by behavior.  For stationary creatures such as plants, dispersal is  


A detailed understanding of this process is important for understanding many

\section{Technical Description}
The primary technical challenge of this project is to simulate the dynamics of an arbitrary solid, such as a seed, falling though a fluid, such as air.  This projcet is only meant to serve as a proof of concept for the research methadology described above, so it will suffice to perform the simulations in 2 dimensions.   

We will implement a stable 2D fluid simulation following the methods outlined in XXX.
