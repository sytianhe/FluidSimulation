@article{putz1999,
	Abstract = {Two exemplary case studies of functional morphology are presented. The first topic, underground plant mobility, illustrates the feedback effect of 'plant structure' and observation of their 'functional role'. Questions are raised in relation to both, 'plant structure' and its 'functional role'. Experiments are developed to obtain answers, and to prompt further questions resulting from these answers. This was shown in an exemplary way in the unusually geophilous strategies of Hemerocallis fulva, well adapted to fulfilling the function 'cryptical survival'. Thus, investigation of functional morphology is useful for a better understanding of plant behaviour. The second case study relates to dispersal of diaspores in Apiaceae. Wind tunnel experiments were carried out to analyze the 'flying ability' of winged or spiny mericarps. In general, winged diaspores fly better than spiny ones, except in the case of Daucus muricatus, the spiny diaspores of which fly better than the winged ones, e.g., of Prangos pabularia. Thus, this topic was useful in showing that functional approaches to 'plant structure' may reveal new perspectives in ecological understanding. However, 'form' and 'function' are frequent in botanical literature, showing that a dualistic treatment of plant structures is very helpful for a better understanding of plant biology. Besides 'underground plant movement' and 'dispersal' there are important topics such as 'floral ecology', 'biomechanics', and many more. All of these could be included in one category, which we propose to call 'plant construction'. Scientific work on 'plant construction' should be based on three basic principles: 1. The starting point of the investigation should be the specific form itself, 2. The scientific question should be functional, and 3. Scientific investigation should be based on targeted observation and experiment.},

@article{levin1989,
	Abstract = {We compared a variety of models for the analysis of data on the wind dispersal of seeds and pollen. Dispersal distances from a source depend upon such factors as settling velocity, height of release, wind speed and turbulence, and specific morphological adaptations for dispersal. The dispersal curve, which describes the frequency distribution of dispersal distances, usually shows its peak at some distance from a source and falls off with distance. We used the location of that peak as a measure of dispersal, and organized data in terms of the predictions of two models for the dynamics of advection and diffusion. These data are summarized in a seed dispersal diagram in which the modal distance normalized by the height of seed release is plotted against the mean with speed normalized by the falling speed of seeds. Data from 15 studies were used to compare actual dispersal relationships.},
